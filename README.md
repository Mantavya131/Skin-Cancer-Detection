# Melanoma Skin Cancer Detection

This project focuses on developing a machine learning solution for the detection of melanoma skin cancer. The objective is to build a model that can accurately distinguish between benign and malignant skin lesions, helping in the early detection and diagnosis of melanoma.

## Overview

Melanoma is a type of skin cancer that can be life-threatening if not detected and treated in its early stages. This project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to develop an automated system that can assist in the detection of melanoma. By analyzing skin lesion images, the model aims to identify potential melanoma cases and provide a recommendation for further medical evaluation.

## Dataset

The project utilizes a dataset containing images of skin lesions. The dataset consists of both benign and malignant lesion images, with annotations indicating the corresponding labels. The dataset used in this project is not provided in this repository due to its size and licensing restrictions, but similar datasets can be obtained from reputable sources or research organizations.

## Models

Different machine learning models were explored and evaluated for the task of melanoma detection. Models such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transfer learning architectures (e.g., VGG16, ResNet) were utilized to leverage their ability to extract features from images and learn complex patterns. The models were trained and evaluated using appropriate performance metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Data Preprocessing

Preprocessing techniques were applied to the dataset to ensure optimal model performance. This included image resizing, normalization, and augmentation to enhance the diversity and quality of the training data. The augmentation techniques employed include rotation, scaling, and horizontal/vertical flips.

## Implementation Details

The project is implemented using Python programming language and popular libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, and OpenCV. The code for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and result analysis is provided in the Jupyter notebooks included in the repository.

## Usage

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

2. Obtain a dataset of skin lesion images with corresponding labels (benign or malignant) from a reliable source or research organization.

3. Place the dataset in the project directory.

4. Open and run the Jupyter notebooks in the following order:

- `1_data_preprocessing.ipynb`

5. Follow the instructions provided in each notebook to preprocess the data, train the models, and evaluate the results.

## Results

The trained models achieved promising results in the detection of melanoma skin cancer. The evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, demonstrate the effectiveness of the models in accurately identifying malignant skin lesions.
